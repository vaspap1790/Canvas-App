INSTRUCTIONS

- Load AngularJS from a CDN
- Initialize you Angular App (name it 'Sketches') using the ng-app directive
- Declare your Angular App in JavaScript and create 
a Controller named 'MainCtrl'.
- Initialize the controller in the HTML by using the ng-controller directive
- Load the JSON data from this URL '"https://api.myjson.com/bins/rwy6k"' using the $http Angular service.
- Once you get the JSON data, replace the Dropdown menu items and the table rows with the JSON data   
- Add a FontAwesome delete icon next to each menu item
    - When the user hovers over this icon, it must change color
    Hint: CSS Pseudo Selectors
    - When the user hovers over this icon, the mouse cursor should look the same as when the user hovers over an anchor tag
- When the user clicks on each delete icon, the specific entry should be deleted from the array and both the table and the menu items should reflect the changes
    - Hint: ng-repeat
    - Hint: use Array splice() to remove a specific element from an array using the element's index position
- If the array is emptied, then display the message "No Sketches found" both in the menu and in the main area
- Make sure that the table cell which displays the private status has a red color if the value is true, or green otherwise
